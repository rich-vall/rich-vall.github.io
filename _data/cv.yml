    - title: 6 Degree of Freedom Robotic Arm
      year: Mar '23-Present
      description: 
        - (WIP) Passion project using servos, Arduino, and 3D printed components designed in SolidWorks.
        - Learning basic Arduino control and circuits to actuate the arm using a series of switches.
        - Currently still in the design stage of the project.
    - title: MAE 3 Robot Contest
      year: Oct '22-Dec '22
      description: 
        - Designed a parallelogram four-bar linkage claw mechanism in Fusion360 used to grab and place object inside of a small container.
        - Performed Quasi-Static Analysis to calculate the required torque in order to grip each object and used a 5:2 gear ratio to obtain a factor of safety higher than 2.
        - Received an award for best presentation in the contest based on the presentation of the overall robot construction and analysis of the four-bar linkage claw mechanism.
    - title: MAE 3 Pendulum Clock
      year: Sep '22-Oct '22
      description: 
        - Designed a pendulum clock in Fusion360 which functioned via an escapement wheel mechanism.
        - Calculated the period of oscillation of the pendulum using a rigid-body assumption and compared it to experimental values to determine possible sources of error.
        - Utilized AutoCAD to generate a dxf file to laser cut the pendulum clock and manufactured and assembled the clock mechanism using machine shop tools.
    - title: Low-Cost Hands-Free Switch
      year: Sep '21-Dec '21
      description: 
        - Worked in a team of four to design a simple hands-free light switch that activites based on a proximty sensor. 
        - Created in an effort to provide a low-cost home automation technology that normally is inaccessible to certain populations due to cost or ease of use.
        - Designed the electronics housing and switch actuation using Fusion360.
        - Manufactured a test setup for the project using drywall, wood, and common lightbulb circuit components.
