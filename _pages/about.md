Hello! My name is Richard Vallejo, I am a second-year student at the University of California San Diego majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Controls and Robotics. 

I am passionate about the fields of Robotics and Engineering Education. I strive to learn more about mechanical, electronic, and software systems, as well as gather valuable experience in mentorship and teaching positions.

In my free time, I love making art with spray paint, learning to cook new recipes, and working on passion projects. I am currently in the design stage of a 6-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, learning the basics of Arduino controls and circuits in the process.
