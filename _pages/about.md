#Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! My name is Richard Vallejo, I am a second-year student at the University of California San Diego majoring in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Controls and Robotics. 

I am passionate about the fields of Robotics and Engineering Education. I strive to learn more about mechanical, electronic, and software systems, as well as gather valuable experience in mentorship and teaching positions.

In my free time, I love making art with spray paint, learning to cook new recipes, and working on passion projects. I am currently in the design stage of a 6-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, learning the basics of Arduino controls and circuits in the process.
